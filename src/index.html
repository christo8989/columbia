  <div>
    <h1>Food</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>One scoop (1/2 cup).</li>
      <li>One "Cranberry Comfort" treat, for medical reasons.</li>
      <li>Twice a day. Once in the morning (8am). Once at night (6pm).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h1>Potty</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>After waking up.</li>
      <li>During her walk, before dinner.</li>
      <li>Before bed.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h1>Walks</h1>
    <p>At least one walk a day, if possible. She loves walks so go as many as you'd like.</p>
    <p>
      We try to keep her from tugging by saying "Easy" if she starts tugging, and the jolting her left or right if she
      doesn't listen.
      It's completely safe and what the trainer taught us. It mostly simulates a fake bite instead of actually hurting
      her.

    <h1>Dictionary</h1>

    <p>* <i>She knows these words even when she acts like she doesn't.</i></p>
