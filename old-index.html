  <div>
    <h1>Punishment</h1>
    <p>Dogs socialize different from humans. In short, they will not listen if they don't recognize you as the leader.</p>
    <p>Recognizing you as the leader <b>helps keep her safe</b> in case she gets loose or she needs to listen in a split second.</p>

    <h3>Training</h3>
    <p>During training, we punish our dog with "<b>tss</b>", "<b>ch</b>", and "<b>Ay!</b>".</p>
    <p>If she's not listening to a command, use those sounds to tell her to listen. Get LOUD if you need to.</p>
    <p>When she listens, reward her.</p>

    <h3>Dog Walks</h3>
    <p>
      Use the collar with the plastic spikes (it sounds harsher than it is).
      If she's not listening, <b>sharply tug left or right until she listens</b>.
    </p>
    <p>When she listens, reward her.</p>

    <h3>Safety First</h3>
    <p>I want to reiterate, this ultimately will keep her safe over the long run.</p>
